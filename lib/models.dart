/// A library that manages and controls the state of the app. 
/// 
/// This library is comprised of classes that have methods to allow simple control over the app's
/// state, which can have side effects as well. For example, adjusting the speed of the rover will 
/// change the value of the on-screen speedometer while also commanding the rover to move faster.

/// This library may depend on the data and services library.
