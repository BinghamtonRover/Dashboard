# Rover Control Dashboard
The Rover Control Dashboard is a graphical desktop application the Binghamton University Rover Team will use to operate and monitor the rover. It is a vital part of our remote command station.

We are redesigning and rebuilding our remote operating interfaces using more modern toolkits to promote rapid development and deployment. Visit [BinghamtonRover/BurtOS-2](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/BurtOS-2) for command software from the 2022 competition year.
